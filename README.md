Learn Ruby - Step-by-Step

This is a Simplified Ruby guide, with comments and detailed explanations provided in the files for each lesson.

How to access the lessons:

Every lesson has its dedicated branch within the repository, and the preceding lesson's code is also available in case you wish to refer to it. To view the code for a specific lesson, simply choose the appropriate option from the "branch" drop-down menu. For example, the "01-put-method" branch includes the final code for the nth lesson in the curriculum.
