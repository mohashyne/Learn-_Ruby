# rand : it dose not needs to be called
# just think about like  "puts"

puts rand # auto generate ranndom num i.e 0.3342900

puts rand.round(2) # 0.33 , it   will round the total number to two

puts rand(100) # will generate between  1-99 but not  100

puts rand * 100 # will generate floating num between  1-99 but not inclluding 100

puts rand(50..69)
