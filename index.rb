# methods

p "Hello world".length

p "Hello world".upcase
 
# .swapcase is also available, but it's not recommended to use this method because of its name collision with the Ruby class method that

# p "HI WORLD".swapcase 

p "HI WORLD I AM DOWN".downcase 


foo = "hello guys"

p foo.upcase


# .reverse is also available

p "Hello world".reverse


# next : it increaments integer by 1 

p 10.next 

p -3.next  # output -3 + 1 = -2


#  inspect
puts "Hi Everyone";
puts "Hi Everyone".inspect  # same as  p "Hi Everyone"
